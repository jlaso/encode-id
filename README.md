# Encode ID

Useful to encode a regular ID into a something that looks like a key or a hash.


## How it works

It works like a regular converter between diferent bases, but the destination base has a lot of characters and then the result looks like more impressive.


## Install in your project

Just require it in your Gemfile

```
gem 'encode-id'
```
